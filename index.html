			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hi everyone!! My name is Khadija Khalek and I am transfer student from the College of DuPage. I am majoring in Computer Science and I expect to graduate by December 2023. 
            I commute to Lewis so I live with my parents and I have two younger brothers and one younger sister. I got engaged last May and I am getting married at the end of the year! I am extremely excited to start this new journey and finally be done with my CS degree.</p>

            <h2>My Favorite Hobbies and Activites</h2>
                <p>My favorite hobby is reading. I spend most of my time reading and looking for new book recommendations. If I am not spending most of my days in the library just doing homework I will spend my time trying to finish a book I just picked up. I also enjoy baking a lot and I always wished I started a business with it but it was kind of impossible after starting college. </p>
